    <h4> To whom it may concern:</h4>
    <p>
    I did not initiate this communication, nor any orders or transactions associated therewith, nor did I authorize the creation of any user or customer accounts or profiles in my name, or using my email address.
    </p>
    <p>
    Please permanently close any accounts, delete any user or customer profiles, re-stock any orders, and reverse any transactions associated with my email address, and then permanently block and remove it from all databases, CRM systems, address books, and other systems in your organization immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
    A complaint with your contact details have been lodged with <a href=https://waspa.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WASPA-Code-of-Conduct-16.6-clean.pdf">WASPA</a> and <a href="https://ispa.org.za/code-of-conduct/lodge-a-mediation-request/">The ISPA</a> as it an offence to send unsolicited electronic communications.
    </p>
    <p>
    Any further communications will be considered a criminal offense and will be dealt with as such.
    </p>
    <p>
    Additionally, you should closely examine and seriously consider updating your organization's policies and processes regarding the handling of confidential user/customer data. It is clear to me that you do NOT currently require new accounts/profiles to use a verified email address. This is a CRITICAL security flaw, exposing your organization to all kinds of potential information security threats and/or data breaches.
    </p>
    <p>
    I hope you find and implement a fix for this issue ASAP.
    </p>
    <p>
    Thank you.
